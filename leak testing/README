In order to check for leaks in the program you can use the following command:

valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --suppressions=supp_rl --track-origins=yes --track-fds=all ./minishell

This command also supresses the leaks from the external readline() function that was used in the project. The command must wun with both the minishell executable and the supp_rl file.

The content of supp_rl should be as followed:

{
    ignore_libreadline_conditional_jump_errors
    Memcheck:Leak
    ...
    obj:/*libreadline.so.*
}
